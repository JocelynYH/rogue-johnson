Way Back, co-produced with Merle Brigante, is Rogue’s band work from Austin, Texas; Trouble Blues was recorded solo, “live in the studio,” in early 2016. Combining his blues roots with an early love of psychedelic rock, Rogue Johnsen writes well-crafted and thoughtful songs that come from the soul.</font></p>
