					recording
					artists out of Oakland and Austin. The only student of the late, great Charles Brown, he’s been a
					sideman for everyone from Bo Diddley to Archie Bell and the Drells.</p>

				<p> In 2016, he released two CD’s of his original music: Way Back and Trouble Blues. Way Back,
					co-produced
					with Merle Brigante, is Rogue’s band work from Austin, Texas; Trouble Blues was recorded solo, “live
					in
					the studio,” in early 2016. Combining his blues roots with an early love of psychedelic rock, Rogue
					Johnsen writes well-crafted and thoughtful songs that come from the soul.</p>

					deep
					into the history of Rock and Blues. In addition to studying with Chuck Israels, Tony Nalker and Ron
					Thompson, Rogue holds the rare distinction of being the only student of the great Charles Brown.</p>

				<p> Having toured extensively with W.C. Clark, Archie Bell & the Drells, and Miss Lavelle White, Rogue’s
					also been a sideman for such legends as Bo Diddley, Johnny Adams, Norton Buffalo, Larry “Arkansas”
					Davis, Sam Andrew and Will Scarlet.</p>

					Cotton,
